# subtitle-organizer
py program to automatically organize your movies subtitles based on the director's name, it uses IMDbPY, so you need to install it before using it


I also recommend to use a aplication like Bulk Rename utility since the imdb don't recognize Space.Battleship.Yamato.2010.JAP.DVDRip.x264.AC3-zdzdz_Track3 as a movie but it does recognize Space.Battleship.Yamato
