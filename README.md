# subtitle-organizer
py program to automatically organize your movies subtitles based on the director's name, it uses IMDbPY, so you need to install it before using it
```pip install IMDbPY```

I also recommend to use a aplication like Bulk Rename utility since the imdb don't recognize Space.Battleship.Yamato.2010.JAP.DVDRip.x264.AC3-zdzdz_Track3 as a movie but it does recognize Space.Battleship.Yamato

How to use it
download the subtitleorganizer.py
run it and copy and paste your directory with the subtitles files, you can do it by clicking on the bar on the top of your folder and clicking cntrl c

If you plan on using manualorganizer you also will need pyperclip
``` pip install pyperclip ```
